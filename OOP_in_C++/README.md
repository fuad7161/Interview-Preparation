# Object Oriented Programming
## Union is not clear yet..
## Defination & Theory
**Class:** A class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object.
**Object:**An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
**Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.
**Polymorphism:** Polymorphism is the attribute that allows one interface to control access to a general class of actions.
**Inheritance:** Inheritance is the process by which one object can acquire the properties of anouther object.
**Constructor:**A constructor is a special funciton that is a **member of a class** and has the same name as that class.
- Constructors will not output or input anything.
- It is automatically called when the object is created.
**Friend Function:** A friend function has access to all private and protected members of the class for which it is a friend. To declear a friend function, include its prototype within the class, preceding it with the keyword friend.



**Benefits of OOP**
* Better code reusability using objects and inheritance.
* Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.
* Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference.
* software complexity can be easily managed.

**Why class is better then structure.**
every thing is same. But the only diffrence is that by default all members are **public in struc** and **privete in class**.

**Unions and Class are related**


## Basic Knowledge
A class contain private and public parts. By default, all items defined in a class are **private**.
